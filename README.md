## Dataset Description
- It has 7 datasets which are users, follows, comments, likes, photos, photo_tags, tags.
- I have first understood the dataset and try to some questions related to Marketing Analysis and Investment metrics.
## Key Insights
- About 26% of users never created any posts among all other users.
- There are a good number of users who are showing interest in participating in contests conducted. Contests can give some sort of award to gain more participants.
- Top 5 tags are smile, beach, party, fun, concert Which says that users are mostly interested in Entertainment related content so it is best to collaborate with brands who are Promoting Entertainment and related fields.
- The partner brands can create posts related to these 5 hashtags to reach most people.
- Most users are registering on Thursdays and Sundays so that would be good time to do an ad campaign.
- There are 13 bots among 100 users which shows that most of the users are real humans and not bots. So, Investors can invest in the app.
